--3 tables Inner Join

Select all salaries of employees, but only the once that led to the new title

So let's say we know that the title changes followes 2 days after the salary raise and title tab has several keys to jpin with the other tables


select a.emp_no, b.salary, b.from_date,c.title
from employees as a
inner join salaries as b on b.emp_no = a.emp_no
inner JOIN titles as c on c.emp_no = a.emp_no 
AND (b.from_date + INTERVAL'2 days') =c.from_date
order by a.emp_no ASC, b.from_date ASC;

select a.emp_no, b.salary, b.from_date,c.title
from employees as a
inner join salaries as b on b.emp_no = a.emp_no
inner JOIN titles as c on c.emp_no = a.emp_no 
AND (b.from_date + INTERVAL'2 days') =c.from_date
order by a.emp_no ASC, b.from_date ASC;
